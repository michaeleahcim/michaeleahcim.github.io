        <h1>Yafira</h1>
        <p> 
        This is my girlfriend Yafira. We have been together for 4 years. From the first day we spent together I knew she would be somebody special in my life. We have been through many ups and many downs but through it all I still feel that special tingle in my heart when I see her. We have many things in common, and we have many things that we disagree on, but all of these things help bring dimension to our relationship. Things aren't always perfect between us but when they are they are in a way that is hard to believe.
