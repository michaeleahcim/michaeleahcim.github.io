	<h1>Full Screen Background</h1>
	<p>
	This was a test to make a fullscreen background slideshow without using a premade javascript plugin. These kinds of backgrounds are popular on websites because of how they fill up the background space nicely and responsively. Taking the fullscreen background to the next level was to make it into a slideshow so multiple images can be displayed. From here it is easy to customize the website in many different ways.
